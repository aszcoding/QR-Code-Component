## My process

I began with the mobile design first, and for this particular project I found that media queries were not necessary. I created my containers first and then worked on styling from the top of the page, down.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was very similar to the NFT preview card component project I completed last week through Frontend Mentor. I used feedback that I received from a fellow coder on my NFT project to group the entire QR card into a <main> element, and then apply the below code to keep it centered on the page.

main {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
  }  

### Continued development

The above tip will definitely be implemented in my future projects.
